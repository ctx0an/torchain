"""Network recovery for Windows - the 'undo everything' safety net.

This is the Windows analogue of the Linux internet.sh / netfix.py. If torchain
(or a crash) ever leaves networking broken, this restores connectivity.

SAFETY MODEL (important on Windows, where a botched network stack is painful
to fix):

* The DEFAULT repair only performs **reversible, connectivity-restoring**
  actions: it puts the firewall's default outbound policy back to *allow*,
  deletes every ``torchain-*`` firewall rule, clears the per-user WinINET
  proxy, flushes the DNS cache and renews the DHCP lease. None of these can
  leave the machine worse off - the worst case is "no change".

* The aggressive stack resets (``netsh winsock reset`` and
  ``netsh int ip reset``) are **opt-in only** via ``deep=True``. They rebuild
  the Winsock catalog and the TCP/IP stack, which *requires a reboot* and can
  disrupt unrelated VPN / proxy / firewall products. We never run them unless
  the user explicitly asks, so a routine "repair internet" can never destabilise
  Windows networking.

Every step is best-effort and isolated, so one failure never blocks the rest.
