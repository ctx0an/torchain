"""Leak / hardening pre-flight scan for Windows.

The Linux build calls this 'migrate' (advisory checks before going live). On
Windows we surface the most common foot-guns: IPv6 still enabled system-wide,
QUIC/HTTP3 (UDP 443) which can bypass a SOCKS-only setup, Teredo tunnelling,
and whether the bundled tor.exe could be located.

Returns a list of (severity, message) advisories; it never changes anything.
