## 🛠️ Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/torchain-pack.git
   cd torchain-pack
   ```

2. **Run Installer locally to install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. **Workspace File Locations:**
   - `torchain`: The primary Bash shell script managing CLI, configuration, and iptables.
   - `gui.py`: The native Python Tkinter graphical HUD.
   - `topt.py`: The downstream proxy forwarding SOCKS5 tunnel daemon.
   - `setup.sh`: Sudo installer script.

## 📝 Code Guidelines

### Shell Scripts (`torchain` / `setup.sh`)
- Follow [Google's Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html).
- Use `[[ ... ]]` instead of `[ ... ]` for tests where possible.
- Avoid using `eval` to load or modify variables to prevent shell injection.
- Ensure any command modifying network configuration has clean error checking and failsafe rollbacks.

### Python Code (`gui.py` / `topt.py`)
- Follow [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- Never use third-party libraries (no `pip install` requirements). Sockets, threading, and GUI must utilize standard library modules only (`socket`, `tkinter`, `urllib.request`).
- All network and CLI calls inside `gui.py` must run in separate daemon threads to prevent UI hangs.
- Close socket streams safely on errors and handle exceptions gracefully.
